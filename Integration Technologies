Enhancing Student Employability in Collaboration with the Industry: Case Study of a Partnership with Amazon Web Services Academy

As tuition fees soar in many parts of the world, universities are being pressed to demonstrate to students the value delivered in return. Students care a lot about getting a good return on their investment, so the best thing they can find is a good balance between the cost of studying and the high quality learning experiences, especially those that will give them practical, hands-on skills and experience in getting a job after graduation. This article describes the process through which a cloud computing course for undergraduates was reimagined jointly with Amazon Web Services (AWS) Academy to address these needs. Industry based labs are also integrated into the course, with engineering students getting hands-on exposure to cloud computing and the internet of things (IoT). Combining academic theory with industry practices, the redesign positions students to develop the theoretical foundation alongside the practical skills they need to be success in their field. This research shows that when when the student are applicable to connect what they learn are more affectively, which ultimately give them a successful careers in cloud computing.

    This study was really focused on revamping a cloud computing module at Queen Mary University of London, or QMUL for short. They teamed up with AWS Academy, which is pretty cool, to bring in some of the latest tech from the industry. The main aim here is was to make sure students come away with the practical skills and knowledge they need, for the ever-changing job market in cloud computing. It's all about preparing them for what’s next in that field.
University tuition fees are increasing. The costs associated with education need a transparent explanation about how they directly improve educational standard and career placement prospects.

The faculty at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) modified their cloud computing module to satisfy industrial expectations. Students received practical experience through the partnership between the organization and Amazon Web Services Academy during the curriculum update. Partnership between QMUL and AWS Academy transformed the program into a practical learning approach with direct industry relevance that led to better career outcomes for graduates. 
The curriculum includes AWS-certified educational contents and students participate in practical hands-on laboratories. The educational system permits students to work directly with actual cloud technologies through this format.

The modules address key topics:

- Scalability
- Virtualization
- Data analytics

Students progress onto advanced topics which include GPU technology alongside CUDA programming. Students achieve readiness for lucrative cloud computing positions because the curriculum provides both theoretical knowledge and practical application of skills.
The lecturers obtained the AWS certification which helped to boost their classroom authority while increasing their teaching confidence. HTTPS certification has become essential to fulfill the industry need for professionals who can add direct business value upon graduation.

The instructional approach combined theoretical content with laboratory work. Through practical activities students used their acquired knowledge to complete real-life simulations.
Workshops became the main focus to increase student involvement in the educational process. Through these planned engagements students examined potential career paths alongside examining which skills they wished to develop. 

The educational system allows students to link their current academic coursework to upcoming professional goals. The educational program equips graduating students with necessary workplace skills. 

Students enrolled in this course learn about professional credentials that include the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam. The program displays specific paths toward careers together with valuable advantages of cloud computing employment opportunities.
This research used surveys alongside performance data and students' reflections to collect data about the redesigned curriculum. The assessment methods allowed investigators to determine how well the intervention worked at enhancing student competencies and employment readiness.

    Through the combination of industrial-standard technologies with certifications within the curriculum the cloud computing module at QMUL motivated students entering a transformational workplace. AWS Academy's implementation and simple learning approach and higher cost formed an effective backing for fee boosts because students would secure better employment than anticipated.
The company's mission focused on using cloud computing capabilities to bridge the gap between education and business by delivering needed learning tools and accreditation to students.
