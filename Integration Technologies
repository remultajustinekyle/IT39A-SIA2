Enhancing Student Employability in Collaboration with the Industry: Case Study of a Partnership with Amazon Web Services Academy

As tuition fees soar in many parts of the world, universities are being pressed to demonstrate to students the value delivered in return. Students care a lot about getting a good return on their investment, so the best thing they can find is a good balance between the cost of studying and the high quality learning experiences, especially those that will give them practical, hands-on skills and experience in getting a job after graduation. This article describes the process through which a cloud computing course for undergraduates was reimagined jointly with Amazon Web Services (AWS) Academy to address these needs. Industry based labs are also integrated into the course, with engineering students getting hands-on exposure to cloud computing and the internet of things (IoT). Combining academic theory with industry practices, the redesign positions students to develop the theoretical foundation alongside the practical

    This study was really focused on revamping a cloud computing module at Queen Mary University of London, or QMUL for short. They teamed up with AWS Academy, which is pretty cool, to bring in some of the latest tech from the industry. The main aim here is was to make sure students come away with the practical skills and knowledge they need, for the ever-changing job market in cloud computing. It's all about preparing them for what’s next in that field.
