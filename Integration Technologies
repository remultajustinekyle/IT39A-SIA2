Enhancing Student Employability in Collaboration with the Industry: Case Study of a Partnership with Amazon Web Services Academy

As tuition fees soar in many parts of the world, universities are being pressed to demonstrate to students the value delivered in return. Students care a lot about getting a good return on their investment, so the best thing they can find is a good balance between the cost of studying and the high quality learning experiences, especially those that will give them practical, hands-on skills and experience in getting a job after graduation. This article describes the process through which a cloud computing course for undergraduates was reimagined jointly with Amazon Web Services (AWS) Academy to address these needs. Industry based labs are also integrated into the course, with engineering students getting hands-on exposure to cloud computing and the internet of things (IoT). Combining academic theory with industry practices, the redesign positions students to develop the theoretical foundation alongside the practical skills they need to be success in their field. This research shows that when when the student are applicable to connect what they learn are more affectively, which ultimately give them a successful careers in cloud computing.

    This study was really focused on revamping a cloud computing module at Queen Mary University of London, or QMUL for short. They teamed up with AWS Academy, which is pretty cool, to bring in some of the latest tech from the industry. The main aim here is was to make sure students come away with the practical skills and knowledge they need, for the ever-changing job market in cloud computing. It's all about preparing them for what’s next in that field.
University tuition fees are increasing. Students, parents, and educators want to see a clear justification for these costs, particularly in terms of education quality and employability.

At Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), a cloud computing module was revised to meet industry demands. The update included collaboration with AWS Academy, allowing students to gain practical experience. This partnership made the course more hands-on and relevant to the industry, enhancing graduates' employability. 
The curriculum now features AWS-certified materials and hands-on labs. This setup allows students to engage with real-world cloud technologies.

The modules address key topics:

- Scalability
- Virtualization
- Data analytics

Students also explore advanced subjects, including GPUs and CUDA programming. This blend of theory and practical skills prepares students for high-demand roles in cloud computing.
Lecturers earned AWS certification to enhance their credibility and confidence in the classroom. This certification meets the increasing demand for skilled graduates ready to contribute immediately.

The teaching method combined theory with practical labs. Students engaged in hands-on experiences, applying their knowledge in realistic simulations.
Workshops were organized to boost student engagement. These sessions allowed students to discuss career paths and reflect on the skills they wanted to develop. 

This approach helps students connect their academic learning with future job goals. It prepares them for the workforce after graduation. 

The course also highlights professional certifications, such as the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam. This showcases clear career paths and the benefits of cloud computing careers.
    By unifying industrial-standard technologies and certifications into the curriculum, QMUL's cloud computing module indeed instigated students who were being appointed to the rapidly changing job market. Induction of AWS Academy along with the ease of the learning process and its increased price was the support for a better argument of charging students higher tuition fees because their future job opportunities would be higher than they expected.
In short, the idea of the company was aimed at narrowing the gap between academia and industry through providing the necessary tools, knowledge, and certifications to the students by cloud computing technology.
